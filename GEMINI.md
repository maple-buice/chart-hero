This project is designed to automatically generate drum charts from audio files. It uses a transformer-based deep learning model to analyze the audio, identify drum patterns, and create corresponding MIDI charts. The system is built to handle large datasets and includes tools for data preparation, model training, inference, and performance analysis.

Key functionalities include:
- **Data Preparation:** Scripts for processing and preparing audio data for training.
- **Model Training:** A comprehensive training pipeline with support for parallel processing and performance monitoring.
- **Inference Engine:** Tools to generate drum charts from new audio files.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Integration with Weights & Biases for monitoring and logging experiments.
