# Centralized Progress Bar System Implementation

## Problem Solved
Previously, when using parallel processing, each worker process would create its own tqdm progress bar, causing visual conflicts and overlapping displays in the terminal. This made it difficult to track actual progress.

## Solution Implemented
Created a **centralized progress callback system** that:

1. **Disables all individual tqdm bars** when a progress callback is provided
2. **Centralizes all progress reporting** through a single `ProgressBarManager` class
3. **Prevents progress bar conflicts** between workers by having only one display point

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `prepare_egmd_data.py`
- **Added `ProgressBarManager` class**: Provides centralized, visual progress tracking
- **Added `--disable-progress-callback` option**: Allows fallback to original tqdm behavior
- **Improved parallel mode display**: Shows worker count and aggregate statistics
- **Better ETA calculation**: More accurate time estimates based on processing speed

### 2. Fixed `data_preparation.py`
- **Sequential Processing**: Completely disables tqdm when callback is provided, uses plain iterator
- **Parallel Processing**: Removed individual worker progress bars, uses only centralized callback
- **Memory-Safe Design**: Progress tracking doesn't interfere with memory management

### 3. Progress Display Features
```
ðŸŽµ E-GMD Data Processing [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] 75.3% (1,502/2,000) | Workers: 3/3 | Records: 45,678 | Mode: Parallel | ETA: 2.3m
```

- **Visual progress bar** with percentage completion
- **Real-time statistics**: Files processed, records generated, memory usage
- **Mode-specific info**: Shows worker count for parallel, current file for sequential
- **Accurate ETA**: Based on actual processing speed

## Usage

### Default (Centralized Progress)
```bash
python prepare_egmd_data.py --dataset-dir datasets/e-gmd-v1.0.0
```

### Fallback to Original tqdm Bars
```bash
python prepare_egmd_data.py --dataset-dir datasets/e-gmd-v1.0.0 --disable-progress-callback
```

## Benefits

1. **No Progress Bar Conflicts**: Single progress display point eliminates overlapping bars
2. **Better Visibility**: Clear, consistent progress information across all processing modes
3. **Centralized Control**: All progress updates go through one callback system
4. **Memory Safe**: Progress tracking doesn't interfere with memory optimization
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Can still use original tqdm bars if needed

## Technical Details

### Callback Function Signature
```python
def progress_callback(current, total, details):
    """
    Args:
        current: Files processed so far
        total: Total files to process  
        details: Dict with mode, worker info, memory stats, etc.
    """
```

### Sequential Mode Details
```python
details = {
    'mode': 'sequential',
    'current_file': 'drummer1/session1/78_jazz-fast_290_beat_4-4.mid',
    'total_records': 45678,
    'memory_gb': 12.4,
    'batch_records': 3500,
    # ... other metrics
}
```

### Parallel Mode Details  
```python
details = {
    'mode': 'parallel', 
    'workers_active': 3,
    'total_workers': 3,
    'total_records_all_workers': 45678,
    'worker_id': 'worker_1',
    # ... other metrics
}
```

This system provides a much cleaner, more informative progress display while preventing the visual conflicts that occurred when multiple workers tried to display progress simultaneously.
