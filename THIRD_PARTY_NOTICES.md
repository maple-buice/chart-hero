- License: BSD 3-Clause (see below)

We consulted Moonscraperâ€™s open-source code to understand the .chart encoding for drums (e.g., pro drums cymbal/ghost/accent flags and drum roll/special event codes). Our Python writer and validators implement compatible behavior. No original Moonscraper source files are redistributed here; where behavior is ported, it is noted in code comments and this notice is provided in accordance with the BSD 3-Clause terms.
