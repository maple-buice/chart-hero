# Production Readiness Report

This report outlines the key findings from a code review of the `chart-hero` project and provides a prioritized action plan to bring it to a functional and efficient production state.

## Key Findings

### 1. Dual Frameworks

The project currently contains a mix of legacy Keras/TensorFlow code and a newer PyTorch-based transformer implementation. This creates confusion, redundancy, and a larger dependency footprint.

### 2. Overly Complex Data Preparation

The `data_preparation.py` script is highly complex, with intricate logic for memory management and parallel processing. While the optimizations are clever, they make the code difficult to maintain and debug.

### 3. Legacy Code

Several scripts, including the Keras-based `create_model.py` and `train_model.py`, were outdated and have been removed.

### 4. Insecure API Key

The `song_identifier.py` script uses a hardcoded API key for the AudD music identification service, which is a significant security risk.

### 5. Lack of Comprehensive Testing

The existing test suite is minimal and does not provide adequate coverage for the data processing pipeline, model architecture, or training loop.

## Action Plan

To address these issues and prepare the project for production, the following actions are recommended, in order of priority:

### Phase 1: Code Unification and Cleanup (High Priority)

1.  **Standardize on PyTorch:**
    *   **Action:** Remove all TensorFlow/Keras-related code and dependencies.
    *   **Rationale:** Simplify the codebase, reduce dependencies, and focus development on the more advanced transformer model.
    *   **Status: Completed.** Legacy Keras scripts (`create_model.py`, `train_model.py`, `train.py`) and models have been removed.

2.  **Refactor `data_preparation.py`:**
    *   **Action:** Simplify the data preparation script, leveraging PyTorch's `DataLoader` for parallel processing.
    *   **Rationale:** A simpler data pipeline is more maintainable and less prone to bugs.

3.  **Deprecate Legacy Scripts:**
    *   **Action:** Remove `create_audio_set.py` and `label_data.py`, integrating their functionality into `transformer_data.py`.
    *   **Rationale:** Centralize data loading and processing logic.

### Phase 2: Security and Testing (Medium Priority)

1.  **Secure API Key:**
    *   **Action:** Move the hardcoded AudD API key to an environment variable or a secure configuration file.
    *   **Rationale:** Prevent the API key from being exposed.

2.  **Expand Test Suite:**
    *   **Action:** Develop a comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.

### Phase 3: Performance and Optimization (Low Priority)

1.  **Optimize `transformer_data.py`:**
    *   **Action:** Profile and optimize the data loading and processing pipeline.
    *   **Rationale:** Reduce training time and allow for more experiments.

2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a systematic hyperparameter search to find the optimal model configuration.
    *   **Rationale:** Improve the model's performance and accuracy.
